Title: This is a small package to work with Gamma convolutions.

Description: Most of the hypergeometric functions available in R are either general-purpose, fixed-precision, or slower than molasses, which makes Gamma convolutions infeasible as a means of background correction for microarrays.  This package simply adapts a multiple-precision confluent hypergeometric 1F1 implementation from the MADNESS project to work with R and address the difficulty described.
